# Sajari Website Search Integration

## Setup

This integration requires a website collection. You can
[Sign Up](https://www.sajari.com/console/sign-up) and create a website
collection to get started.

From the [Install tab](https://www.sajari.com/console/collections/install) in
the Console you can generate a search interface which can be copy-pasted into
your site. It's easy to add further customisations using CSS (see
[Styling](#styling)), or by changing the JSON config (see
[Configuration](#configuration)).

## Styling

The generated interface is designed to be responsive by default, and can be
easily styled to fit your website's look and feel.

Here are a few CSS examples showing how to override the default layout.

### Brand colors

* Override the link/tab colours and font.

* Override the link/tab colours and font.
* Set a brand image.
* Hide URL links in results.

## Integrations

There are 4 types of integration:

* [_inline_](#inline): search box, results. Interface is embedded directly into
  a page (or pages) on your website, for instance a dedicated search page with a
  search box + results.

* [_overlay_](#overlay): full page overlay, search box, results. Interface
  appears as an overlay on top of the current page. Can be used to search
  without leaving the page.

* [_search box_](#search-box): search box. Typical usage includes being embedded
  into headers and menus.

* [_dynamic content_](#dynamic-content): results. Typically used to put
  pre-baked searches into pages, to show similar or popular content, or article
  listings by tag/category etc for landing pages.

It's possible to use [multiple integrations](#multiple-integrations) on the same
site/page. For instance: have a search box in the header of your site, which
then redirects to an inline search results page when triggered.

**NOTE: The code examples in this README assume integrations have been generated
from the [Console](https://www.sajari.com/console/collections/install).
Generated interfaces come with a handful of
[helper functions](#helper-functions) which are referenced in the following
examples.**

### Inline

The inline search integration renders a full search interface (input box and
results) inside a webpage. A typical example would be a dedicated search results
page which is linked to/navigated to by search forms on a website. In the
configuration example given below, the search query can be passed to the page
using the query param q.

```javascript
myUI({
  mode: "inline", // Set the integration mode
  project: "<your project>", // Set this to your project.
  collection: "<your collection>", // Set this to your collection.
  values: { resultsPerPage: "10", q: getUrlParam("q") }, // Default pipeline values
  attachSearchBox: document.getElementById("search-box"), // DOM element to render search box.
  attachSearchResponse: document.getElementById("search-response"), // DOM element to render search results.
  results: { showImages: false }, // Results configuration
  pipeline: "website", // Set this to your search pipeline
  instantPipeline: "autocomplete", // Set this to your instant pipeline
  inputPlaceholder: "Search", // Placeholder text for the input element
  maxSuggestions: 5, // Maximum number of suggestions in the search box
  tabFilters: {} // Tab configuration
});
```

### Overlay

The overlay search integration renders a search interface on top of existing
pages. Typically this is used on sites that prefer not to navigate users away
from their current page to see results.

![overlay interface screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2771466/31525612-3ebe9abc-b00d-11e7-9e2b-1e2f947a717a.png)

```javascript
myUI({
  mode: "overlay", // Set the integration mode
  project: "<your project>",
  collection: "<your collection>",
  values: { resultsPerPage: "10", q: getUrlParam("q") },
  results: { showImages: false },
  pipeline: "website",
  instantPipeline: "autocomplete",
  inputPlaceholder: "Search",
  autocompleteMaxSuggestions: 5,
  inputAutoFocus: true,
  tabFilters: {}
});
```

### Search Box

The Search Box integration creates an autocomplete-enabled input box typically
embedded into site headers and menu bars. It performs autocomplete lookups for
each user keypress and can be customised to redirect to a search results page or
trigger custom search actions.

![search box interface screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2771466/31525645-86e89392-b00d-11e7-91b2-9ddbeb5136a9.png)

```javascript
myUI({
  mode: "search-box", // Set the integration mode
  project: "<your project>",
  collection: "<your collection>",
  instantPipeline: "autocomplete",
  inputPlaceholder: "Search",
  maxSuggestions: 5,
  attachSearchBox: document.getElementById("search-box")
});
```

### Dynamic Content

The Dynamic Content integration creates a results block using search results
from a pipeline. It can typically be used to show similar or popular pages.

![dynamic content interface screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2771466/36003587-dc94f326-0d82-11e8-894e-b19663ade59d.png)

```javascript
myUI({
  mode: "dynamic-content", // Set the integration mode
  project: "<your project>",
  collection: "<your collection>",
  pipeline: "website",
  attachDynamicContent: document.getElementById("dynamic-content"),
  values: { resultsPerPage: "3" },
  results: { showImages: false },
  tracking: false,
  searchOnLoad: true
});
```

### Helper Functions

The generated interface code comes with two helper functions:

* `getUrlParam(x)` extracts a value from a url parameter `x`.
* `setup` creates an object that controls an instance of the integration.

### Multiple Integrations

Every integration is bound to its own variable (using the `setup` function), so
it's easy to have multiple integrations running on the same page. You an also
have them interact with each other by subscribing and publishing events between
them.

```javascript
myUI = setup(...);
secondUI = setup(...);

myUI(...);
secondUI(...);
```

## Configuration

The generated search interfaces are configured using a JSON object. Generating
an interface from the console will prefill the configuration for you, setting
default values where necessary.

By default search boxes have instant enabled and use the pipeline specified by `instantPipeline`. To disable instant searching, set the value of `instantPipeline` to `""`.

### Tab filters

Create tabs to filter search results. Tabs are rendered in a UI component when
search results are shown. If a tab is clicked then the algorithm parameter
`filter` is set to the tab's `filter` attribute.

```javascript
tabFilters: {
   defaultTab: "All", // The title of the default tab.
   tabs: [
      {title: "All", filter: ""},
      {title: "Blog", filter: "dir1='blog'"}, // First directory in URL is 'blog'.
      {title: "Not Blog", filter: "dir1!='blog'"} // First directory in URL is not 'blog'.
   ],
}
```
