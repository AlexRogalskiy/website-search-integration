# Filters

Filters are used to limit the pages that are returned in a search.  Filters can be used in [Tabs](#tab-filters) or by setting the `filter` property in the `values` configuration attribute (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

Our crawler extracts common fields when it parses web pages (such as the first
and second directories of URLs), which make filtering much easier. It's well
worth taking a look at all the extracted fields before you start building
filters, as most use cases are quick and easy to get running.

Here is a list of the most commonly used fields.

* `title` The page title.
* `description` The page description.
* `image` The URL of an image which corresponds to the page.
* `lang` The language of the page, extracted from the `<html>` element (if
  present).

Fields that are based on the URL of the page (ideal for filtering on subsections
of a site) are given below. Examples here assume that the page URL is
`https://www.sajari.com/blog/year-in-review`:

* `url` The full page URL: `https://www.sajari.com/blog/year-in-review`
* `dir1` The first directory of the page URL: `blog`
* `dir2` The second directory of the page URL: `year-in-review`
* `domain` The domain of the page URL: `www.sajari.com`

### Using Operators

When querying a field, there are a few operators that can be used. Note, all
values must be enclosed in single quotation marks, i.e. "field _boost_ must be
greater than 10" is written as `boost>'10'`.

| Operator                        | Description                                            | Example        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| Equal To (`=`)                  | Field is equal to a value (_numeric_ or _string_)      | `dir1='blog'`  |
| Not Equal To (`!=`)             | Field is not equal to a value (_numeric_ or _string_)  | `dir1!='blog'` |
| Greater Than (`>`)              | Field is greater than a _numeric_ value                | `boost>'10'`   |
| Greater Than Or Equal To (`>=`) | Field is greater than or equal to a _numeric_ value    | `boost>='10'`  |
| Less Than (`<`)                 | Field is less than a given _numeric_ value             | `boost<'50'`   |
| Less Than Or Equal To (`<=`)    | Field is less than or equal to a given _numeric_ value | `boost<'50'`   |
| Begins With (`^`)               | Field begins with a _string_                           | `dir1^'bl'`    |
| Ends With (`$`)                 | Field ends with a _string_                             | `dir1$'og'`    |
| Contains (`~`)                  | Field contains a _string_                              | `dir1~'blog'`  |
| Does Not Contain (`!~`)         | Field does not contain a _string_                      | `dir1!~'blog'` |

### Combining expressions

It's also possible to build more complex filters by combining field filter
expressions with `AND`/`OR` operators, and brackets.

| Operator | Description                 | Example                                   |
| -------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `AND`    | Both expressions must match | `dir1='blog' AND domain='www.sajari.com'` |
| `OR`     | One expression must match   | `dir1='blog' OR domain='blog.sajari.com'` |

For example, to match pages with language set to `en` on `www.sajari.com` or any
page within the `en.sajari.com` domain:

    (domain='www.sajari.com' AND lang='en') OR domain='en.sajari.com'
